Improving Digital Map Data Accuracy using OpenStreetMap and Python

Objective:
Enhance the accuracy of digital maps by comparing official hospital location data with OpenStreetMap data to identify missing or inconsistent entries.

Tools Used:

Python
Pandas
GeoPandas
Folium (for map visualization)
OpenStreetMap (data source)

Workflow:

Extracted hospital data from OpenStreetMap for a selected city

Created a small official dataset for comparison

Verified and matched hospitals between datasets

Identified missing or inconsistent map entries

Visualized all hospitals on an interactive map

Results:

Matched Hospitals: Found in both datasets

Unmatched Hospitals: Missing in OSM â†’ flagged for improvement

Interactive visualization available in map.html
